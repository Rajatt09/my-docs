# Clean Code Principles

Writing clean code is essential for maintaining and scaling software projects. Here are some key principles to follow:

## 1. Meaningful Names
- Use descriptive and unambiguous names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Avoid using single-letter names or vague terms.

## 2. Functions Should Do One Thing
- Each function should have a single responsibility.
- If a function is doing more than one thing, consider breaking it into smaller functions.

## 3. Keep It Simple
- Aim for simplicity in your code. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Use straightforward logic and clear structures.

## 4. Comment Wisely
- Write comments to explain why something is done, not what is done.
- Avoid redundant comments that restate the code.

## 5. Consistent Formatting
- Maintain consistent indentation, spacing, and line breaks.
- Use a style guide to ensure uniformity across the codebase.

## 6. Error Handling
- Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.
- Avoid using exceptions for control flow.

## 7. Testing
- Write tests for your code to ensure it behaves as expected.
- Aim for high test coverage to catch potential issues early.

By adhering to these principles, you can create code that is easier to read, maintain, and extend over time.
