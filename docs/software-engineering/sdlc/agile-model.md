# Agile Model & Its Frameworks

## What is Agile?

The Agile Model is an iterative and incremental software development approach that emphasizes:

- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Working software over documentation
- Responding to change over following a strict plan
- Continuous delivery & improvement

Unlike the Waterfall model, which follows a strict sequence, Agile is flexible, adaptive, and fast-paced.

## User Stories

User stories are a key component of agile software development. They are short, simple descriptions of a feature or functionality from the perspective of a user.

### Pattern of User Story

User stories are completely from the end-user perspective which follows the Role-Feature-Benefit pattern.

- As a [ type of user ], I want [ an action ], so that [ some reason ]

### Writing User Stories

User stories are from a user perspective. So when user stories are written, users are given more importance during the process. Some points outlined which are taken into consideration during writing user stories like

- Requirements
- Tasks and their subtasks
- Actual user
- Importance to user words/feedback
- Breaking user stories for larger requirements

### INVEST Principles of User Stories

A good user story should be based on INVEST principle which expresses the quality of the user story.

- Independent â€“ Not dependent on other.
- Negotiable â€“ Includes the important avoid contract.
- Valuable â€“ Provide value to customer.
- Estimable â€“ It should be estimated.
- Small â€“ It should be simple and small not complex.
- Testable â€“ It should be evaluated by pre-written acceptance criteria.

### Câ€™s in User Stories

- Card â€“ Write stories on cards, prioritize, estimate and schedule it accordingly.
- Conversation â€“ Conduct conversations, Specify the requirements and bring clarity.
- Confirmation â€“ Meet the acceptance criteria of the software.

## Phases of Agile Development

Agile follows an iterative approach, meaning the software is developed in small increments (sprints or iterations).

### 1. **Concept & Initiation**

- Define project vision and high-level goals.
- Identify key stakeholders and set expectations.

### 2. **Planning**

- Break down requirements into user stories and prioritize them.
- Plan sprints (typically 1-4 weeks).

### 3. **Design & Development**

- Develop small working features in each sprint.
- Continuous integration and testing are done simultaneously.

### 4. **Testing & Review**

- Frequent testing ensures quality.
- Stakeholders review and provide feedback after each sprint.

### 5. **Release & Deployment**

- Each sprint delivers a working software increment to the users.
- Deployment is done continuously (CI/CD pipeline).

### 6. **Maintenance & Continuous Improvement**

- Gather feedback and improve the next sprint.
- Monitor performance and apply patches.

## Agile Frameworks & Methodologies

Agile isnâ€™t a single process but has multiple frameworks that implement Agile principles differently. Here are the most popular ones:

### 1. Scrum (Most Popular)

ðŸ”¹ **Best for:** Teams working on complex projects with evolving requirements.

ðŸ”¹ **Key Features:**

- Work is divided into Sprints (1-4 weeks).
- The team follows Daily Stand-up Meetings (15 min).
- Defined roles: Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team.
- Sprint Review & Retrospective after each sprint.

-- Scrum Master â€“ Removes obstacles, ensures Agile principles.

-- Product Owner â€“ Defines features, prioritizes backlog.

-- Development Team â€“ Delivers the work in Sprints.

ðŸ”¹ **Example Use Cases:**

- Mobile app development (WhatsApp, Instagram).
- Game development (incremental feature releases).

```

### 2. Kanban (Visual Workflow Management)

ðŸ”¹ **Best for:** Continuous delivery projects that require real-time tracking.

ðŸ”¹ **Key Features:**

- Uses a Kanban Board to track work progress.
- Work items move from To Do â†’ In Progress â†’ Done.
- Focus on reducing bottlenecks and improving workflow efficiency.
- No fixed iterations like Scrum; work is continuously delivered.

  ðŸ”¹ **Example Use Cases:**

- Customer support systems (Zendesk, ServiceNow).
- Content publishing workflows (Blogs, YouTube video releases).

```

### 3. Extreme Programming (XP) (Code-Focused)

ðŸ”¹ **Best for:** High-risk projects that require fast-paced coding & testing.

ðŸ”¹ **Key Features:**

- Test-Driven Development (TDD) â€“ Write tests before coding.
- Pair Programming â€“ Two developers work on the same code together.
- Continuous Integration (CI) â€“ Code is frequently merged and tested.
- Customer involvement in every sprint.

ðŸ”¹ **Example Use Cases:**

- FinTech applications (real-time transactions, fraud detection).
- AI and machine learning projects (frequent model tuning).

### 4. Lean Software Development (Speed & Efficiency)

ðŸ”¹ **Best for:** Companies that focus on eliminating waste and maximizing value.

ðŸ”¹ **Key Features:**

- Minimize unnecessary work (avoid extra documentation).
- Automate repetitive tasks.
- Deliver software as quickly as possible.
- Encourage team empowerment & decision-making.

ðŸ”¹ **Example Use Cases:**

- E-commerce platforms (Amazon, Flipkart).
- Startups building MVPs (Minimum Viable Products).
