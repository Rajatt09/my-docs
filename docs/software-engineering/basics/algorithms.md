# Algorithms

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. They are essential in programming and software engineering. Here are some basic types of algorithms:

## Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms arrange the elements of a list in a specific order, usually in ascending or descending order. Common sorting algorithms include:

1. **Bubble Sort**: A simple algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

2. **Selection Sort**: This algorithm divides the input list into two parts: a sorted and an unsorted part. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part.

3. **Insertion Sort**: This algorithm builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It takes each element from the input and finds the appropriate position in the sorted part of the array.

4. **Merge Sort**: A more efficient, recursive algorithm that divides the list into halves, sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together.

5. **Quick Sort**: Another efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach. It selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

## Searching Algorithms

Searching algorithms are used to find specific data within a structure. Common searching algorithms include:

1. **Linear Search**: This algorithm checks each element in the list until the desired element is found or the list ends.

2. **Binary Search**: This algorithm is more efficient than linear search but requires the list to be sorted. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half, checking if the target value is in the left or right half.

Understanding these algorithms is crucial for writing efficient code and solving complex problems in software engineering.
