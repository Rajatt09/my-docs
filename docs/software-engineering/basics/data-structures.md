# Data Structures

## Arrays
An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. It allows you to store multiple items of the same type together. You can access elements using their index, which starts at 0.

## Linked Lists
A linked list is a data structure where each element (node) contains a value and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory, allowing for efficient insertions and deletions.

## Stacks
A stack is a collection of elements that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. You can add (push) and remove (pop) elements from the top of the stack only. It is commonly used for tasks like undo mechanisms in applications.

## Queues
A queue is a collection of elements that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. You can add (enqueue) elements at the back and remove (dequeue) elements from the front. Queues are useful in scenarios like task scheduling.
