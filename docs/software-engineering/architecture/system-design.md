# System Design

System design is a crucial aspect of software engineering that focuses on how to build scalable and efficient systems. Here are some key concepts to understand:

## 1. Scalability
Scalability refers to the ability of a system to handle increased load without compromising performance. There are two types of scalability:
- **Vertical Scaling**: Adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more machines to distribute the load.

## 2. Performance
Performance is about how quickly a system responds to requests. Key factors affecting performance include:
- **Latency**: The time it takes to process a request.
- **Throughput**: The number of requests a system can handle in a given time frame.

## 3. Load Balancing
Load balancing distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed. This improves responsiveness and availability.

## 4. Caching
Caching stores frequently accessed data in memory to reduce the time it takes to retrieve it. This can significantly improve performance.

## 5. Database Design
Choosing the right database and designing it effectively is crucial for system performance. Considerations include:
- **Normalization**: Organizing data to reduce redundancy.
- **Indexing**: Creating indexes to speed up data retrieval.

## 6. Microservices
Microservices architecture breaks down applications into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled individually.

## 7. API Design
Designing clear and efficient APIs is essential for enabling communication between different parts of a system or between different systems.

Understanding these concepts will help you design systems that are robust, scalable, and maintainable.
