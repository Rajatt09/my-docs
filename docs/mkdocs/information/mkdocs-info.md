# MkDocs Setup Information

## Introduction

MkDocs is a static site generator that's geared towards project documentation. It is written in Python and is easy to configure and deploy.

## Installation

To install MkDocs, use the following command:

```bash
pip install mkdocs
```

## Creating a New Project

To create a new MkDocs project, run:

```bash
mkdocs new my-project
cd my-project
```

## Running the Project

To start the live-reloading docs server, use:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

You can then view the documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Building the Documentation

To build the documentation, run:

```bash
mkdocs build
```

This will create a `site` directory with your static site.
